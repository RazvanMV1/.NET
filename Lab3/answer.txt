If pagination (Skip() / Take()) is applied after calling .ToList(), the query is already materialized.
This means Entity Framework Core has executed the SQL and loaded all records from the database into memory.
As a result, pagination happens in memory instead of being translated into SQL.

This is problematic for large datasets because:

all rows are loaded into RAM, which increases memory usage;

it transfers unnecessary data from the database;

performance and scalability decrease as the dataset grows.
